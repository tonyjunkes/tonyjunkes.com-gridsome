            <p>If you've made it here, you most likely followed an old relic of a link that went to truthseekersbp.com. While the Blood Pledge met its unfortunate demise back in 2012 when NCSoft West chose to pull the plug on our beloved Lineage, I have made sure to preserve what we all shared for over 6 years!</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>So where's the site then? Well, the site itself basically sat in maintenance mode on a server I rarely logged in to, but still paid the bills for. You see, there are cheaper alternatives these days for hosting, and since I was really just maintaining our photo gallery section of almost 500+ photos, I wanted to pull everything down, regroup, and get something more maintainable put in place.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>This effort to move everything to such a platform is totally doable. However, my enemy is time. I'll get it all back in place though soon enough.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>I'm not sure how many of the old crew actually still frequented the site, but I hope it brought back fond memories for those who did. Perhaps one day we can reunite in a Lineage world. Until then... All the best!</p>
